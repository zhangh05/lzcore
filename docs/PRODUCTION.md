# 生产部署与运行

本文描述当前生产配置与操作边界。LZCore 将记录存储、对象存储和作业队列分离，可按部署 profile 组合 PostgreSQL、S3 与 Redis。配置、密钥、工作区数据和备份均为环境状态，不应进入 Git 或镜像。

## Supported production profile

The repository includes a fail-closed single-node production profile at
`deployment/compose.production.yml`. It runs a Gunicorn backend, job worker,
static Nginx frontend, TLS gateway, PostgreSQL, Redis, S3-compatible object
storage, Prometheus, Alertmanager and Grafana. Copy
`deployment/.env.production.example`, create the referenced secret and TLS
files, then validate before starting:

```bash
docker compose --env-file /etc/lzcore/production.env \
  -f deployment/compose.production.yml config
docker compose --env-file /etc/lzcore/production.env \
  -f deployment/compose.production.yml up -d --build
docker compose --env-file /etc/lzcore/production.env \
  -f deployment/compose.production.yml exec backend \
  python scripts/production_preflight.py --live
```

The public listener is TLS-only. Frontend and backend ports remain internal to
the Compose network. API, login and session secrets are mounted as files rather
than committed or baked into images.

Python execution requires a verified image digest and a Docker daemon. Use a
dedicated rootless daemon/socket where possible; never expose an unauthenticated
Docker TCP endpoint. The backend fails closed when the daemon or pinned image is
unavailable.

This profile intentionally runs one Web process and one worker. Filesystem data
that has not moved into PostgreSQL/S3 is shared through `lzcore-data`; do not
scale Web or worker replicas until the distributed integration suite and the
target volume's locking semantics have been validated.

## Network listener security and fail-closed binding

By default, backend services bind exclusively to loopback (`127.0.0.1` / `localhost`).

When configuring non-loopback exposure (e.g. `0.0.0.0` or a public interface via `LZCORE_LISTEN_HOST` or `--host`):
- **Fail-closed authentication requirement**: The backend startup sequence (`validate_network_listener`) strictly refuses to bind to non-loopback interfaces without effective authentication configured.
- **Supported authentication configurations**:
  1. API Token Authentication: `LZCORE_AUTH_ENABLED=true` together with `LZCORE_API_TOKEN` (or mounted file `LZCORE_API_TOKEN_FILE`).
  2. Web Login Authentication: `LZCORE_LOGIN_USERNAME` together with `LZCORE_LOGIN_PASSWORD` (or mounted file `LZCORE_LOGIN_PASSWORD_FILE`).
  3. Enterprise Identity Authentication: `LZCORE_IDENTITY_ENABLED=true` (OIDC/OAuth2 SSO).
- **Explicit override**: In isolated development sandboxes or container tests where unauthenticated network access is intentional, `LZCORE_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_NETWORK=true` may be set; this emits an explicit critical security warning.

## Single-server Compose profile

An existing single host that intentionally keeps filesystem records, workspace
data and provider configuration on that host can use
`deployment/compose.server.yml`. It manages the backend, worker and static
frontend without requiring the PostgreSQL/Redis/MinIO/TLS stack. The public
HTTP entry defaults to port `5273`; the backend binds only to loopback port
`8011` and is reached by the frontend proxy.

Keep the existing root-only `.env.local`, create `deployment/.env` with the
Docker socket group id, and make the bind-mounted runtime directories writable
by container uid/gid `10001`:

```bash
printf 'LZCORE_DOCKER_SOCKET_GID=%s\n' \
  "$(stat -c '%g' /var/run/docker.sock)" > deployment/.env
chown -R 10001:10001 workspaces config/providers
scripts/deploy_server_compose.sh
docker compose -f deployment/compose.server.yml ps
```

服务器更新必须使用上述脚本。它会统一重建 backend、worker 和 frontend，校验
backend/worker 使用同一镜像，并在返回成功前检查前后端就绪接口；不要只更新部分服务。

发布完成后至少验证同一提交、容器状态、后端健康和前端代理；涉及 QueryLoop、工具或恢复合同的发布还要在 backend 容器中运行对应 focused harness。示例：

```bash
git rev-parse HEAD
docker compose -f deployment/compose.server.yml ps
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8011/api/health
curl -fsSI http://127.0.0.1:5273/
docker compose -f deployment/compose.server.yml exec -T backend \
  python -m pytest -q harness/test_goal_loop.py harness/test_network_read_recovery.py
```

检查公开入口时还应通过前端代理访问 `/api/health`，不能只依据容器内 liveness 宣称实际页面已可用。

Do not run `start.sh` or retain screen-managed backend/frontend processes on
the same ports while this Compose project is active.

## Enterprise login

Optional OpenID Connect login is enabled with
`LZCORE_OIDC_ENABLED=true`, an HTTPS issuer, client ID, client-secret
file and `LZCORE_PUBLIC_URL`. OIDC users are never auto-provisioned:
the administrator must create the matching username and workspace grants first,
so an identity-provider account cannot invent local privileges. Password login
can remain as the bootstrap recovery path. OIDC complements rather than replaces
the route/role/workspace authorization matrix.

Start the profile with the OIDC override after adding the optional values shown
in `.env.production.example`:

```bash
docker compose --env-file /etc/lzcore/production.env \
  -f deployment/compose.production.yml -f deployment/compose.oidc.yml up -d
```

## Adapter configuration

```bash
export LZCORE_RECORD_STORE_MODE=postgres
export LZCORE_DATABASE_URL='postgresql://...'
export LZCORE_OBJECT_STORE_MODE=s3
export LZCORE_OBJECT_STORE_BUCKET='lzcore-artifacts'
export LZCORE_OBJECT_STORE_PREFIX='production'
export LZCORE_QUEUE_MODE=redis
export LZCORE_QUEUE_URL='redis://...'
```

网络配置权限由已发布 Skill 的运行配置核定。结果未知的外部写入进入操作账本并等待
read-back/reconcile，平台不会自动重放非幂等操作。

`GET /api/health` is the lightweight liveness check. `GET /api/ready` performs
real writable/connectivity checks for record storage, object storage, and the
queue, and includes worker heartbeat state. It returns HTTP 503 when a required
dependency is unavailable. The 系统状态 page shows the same components.

Prometheus metrics are served at `/metrics`, and a JSON projection is available
at `/api/metrics`. Metrics use route templates rather than raw URLs, preventing
workspace/job IDs from creating unbounded labels. When API authentication is
enabled, both metric endpoints require the configured bearer token or session.
The supplied Prometheus configuration reads that token from the same Docker
secret. Alert rules and the initial Grafana dashboard live under
`deployment/observability`; replace the placeholder Alertmanager receiver before
go-live and follow `docs/OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md` during incidents.

## Worker leases

Redis workers claim a job with a durable lease, periodically renew it, and place
stale leases back on the queue with an incremented attempt. Configure:

```bash
export LZCORE_JOB_LEASE_SECONDS=120
export LZCORE_WORKER_STALE_SECONDS=180
export LZCORE_WORKER_ID='worker-a'
```

The worker status endpoint reports the worker ID, attempt, heartbeat age, and a
`stale` state when a running worker stops renewing.

Queue execution is deliberately **at least once**: a process can lose its lease
after an external side effect but before acknowledgement. Extension and workflow
job handlers must therefore use idempotency keys (normally the job ID plus step
ID) for writes to external systems.

## Verified backup and restore

Backups contain the complete workspace data plane and runtime control records.
Every file has a SHA-256 entry in the archive manifest. Snapshot creation retries
if files change while they are copied; restore rejects traversal paths, links,
device files, duplicate paths, altered hashes, and inconsistent totals.

```bash
python3 scripts/backup_cli.py create
python3 scripts/backup_cli.py list
python3 scripts/backup_cli.py verify /path/to/backup.tar.gz
python3 scripts/backup_cli.py restore backup-... --confirm RESTORE
python3 scripts/backup_cli.py prune --keep 10
```

The default archive directory is `.lzcore-backups` beside the workspace
root. Set `LZCORE_BACKUP_DIR` to encrypted off-host storage in production.
Restore atomically moves the current data plane to a named rollback directory
before activating the verified snapshot. The same operations are exposed under
`/api/admin/backups` and require an administrator in identity mode.

## Immutable release slots

Build the frontend first, then stage and activate a release:

```bash
npm --prefix frontend run build
python3 scripts/release_slots.py --release-root /opt/lzcore stage 1.4.0
python3 scripts/release_slots.py --release-root /opt/lzcore activate 1.4.0 \
  --health-url http://127.0.0.1:8011/api/ready
```

The service should execute from `/opt/lzcore/current`. Activation swaps a
symlink atomically and retains the prior slot. If the optional readiness check
fails, the CLI immediately switches back. Manual rollback is:

```bash
python3 scripts/release_slots.py --release-root /opt/lzcore rollback
```

Environment files, workspaces, logs, reports, virtual environments, and source
control metadata are never copied into immutable release slots. Keep configuration
and durable data outside the release directory.
