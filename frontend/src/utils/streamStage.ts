/* ── Event taxonomy ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   A timeline row has to say what kind of step it was. The previous version
   guessed from substrings of the event name — `tool` was coloured as a warning,
   `semantic_invalid` fell through to "no colour", and any new stage inherited
   whatever tone its spelling happened to match. The kinds below are explicit,
   and a stage that is not listed is reported as `unknown` rather than guessed.
   Colour is deliberately not part of this: it carries the outcome, while the
   kind is carried by an icon and a label so the row reads without colour. */
